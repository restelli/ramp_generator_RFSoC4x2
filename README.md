# Ramp generator for RFSoC4x2

Work in progress.

* Example code and Python driver is in [Notebooks](./Notebooks) folder
* Verilog code that generates the ramp is in [src/hdl](./src/hdl) folder and in [src/sim](./src/sim)
**main.hwh** and **main.bit** file are not provided at the moment: they must be copyed in the [Notebooks](./Notebooks) folder in order for the driver to work.
* The script that generates the Vivado design is also not provided at the moment.

* The only channel that works is channel B
